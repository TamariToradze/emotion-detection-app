Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask
Emotion Detector

This repository contains the final project for the course **"Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask"** in the **IBM Full Stack Software Developer Certificate** program. The goal of this project is to build an AI-powered Flask web application that analyzes a user-provided text string and predicts the most likely emotion being expressed (from a predefined set of emotions).

The project integrates **Flask** for web application development and a **machine learning model** for emotion detection. Users can enter any text, and the application will process it and return the predicted emotion in real time.
